## Projects for Algorithm-1

##### This is course projects for Coursera online course: Algorithm-1

* week1: Implemented a java program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.
* week2: Implemented a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. 
* week3: Implemented a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points. Given a set of N distinct points in the plane, it could draw every (maximal) line segment that connects a subset of 4 or more of the points.
* week4: Implemented a program to solve 8-puzzle problem. The 8-puzzle problem is a puzzle invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s. It is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square blocks labeled 1 through 8 and a blank square. Implemented program is able to rearrange the blocks so that they are in order, using least number of steps
* week5: Implemented a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square (all points have x- and y-coordinates between 0 and 1) using a 2d-tree to support efficient range search (find all of the points contained in a query rectangle) and nearest neighbor search (find a closest point to a query point). 2d-trees have numerous applications, ranging from classifying astronomical objects to computer animation to speeding up neural networks to mining data to image retrieval.
